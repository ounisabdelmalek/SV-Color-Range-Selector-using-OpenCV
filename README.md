# SV-Color-Range-Selector-using-OpenCV
 This simple OpenCV tool helps you interactively select and visualize a color range in the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space using trackbars. It's useful for color segmentation tasks such as object detection, image masking, and preprocessing in computer vision projects.
