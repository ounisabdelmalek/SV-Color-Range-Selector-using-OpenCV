# ðŸŽ¨ HSV Color Range Selector using OpenCV

This simple OpenCV tool helps you interactively select and visualize a color range in the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space using trackbars. It's useful for color segmentation tasks such as object detection, image masking, and preprocessing in computer vision projects.

)

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Load and resize an input image.
- Convert the image to HSV color space.
- Use OpenCV trackbars to dynamically adjust:
  - Lower Hue, Saturation, Value (LH, LS, LV)
  - Upper Hue, Saturation, Value (UH, US, UV)
- See the resulting mask and segmented output in real time.
- Press `q` to quit the app.

## ðŸ§  How It Works
The script uses `cv2.inRange()` to create a binary mask where the HSV values are within the selected range, then applies `cv2.bitwise_and()` to extract the relevant part of the image.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
